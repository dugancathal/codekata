# Kata 6 - Anagrams

## Summary

The ask is to build an anagram finder that works by accepting a dictionary and
returning the number of anagrams in the file.

The file [wordlist.txt](wordlist.txt) that is included in this directory was
provided by Dave and includes "2,530 sets of anagrams (a total of 5,680 words)".
