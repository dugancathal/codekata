# Kata 1 - Supermarket Pricing

## Summary

An interesting kata that requires no code, this one asks you think about the
various ways of valuing items in a store. Is fractional money a thing? How to
you manage "buy two, get one free"? If an item is "buy three for a dollar", how
do you handle buying 4, or 5?

itself, we're faced first with the concept of fractional money. In the USD
system, it isn't, though I suppose that vaguely depends on your level of
abstraction. The quanta of USD is the penny, the smallest possible
representation of actual money.
