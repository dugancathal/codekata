# Kata 2 - Binary Search

## Summary

A favorite topic of _all_ CS professors, the challenge this time is to implement
5 *different* versions of binary search. My roadmap looks like this:

1. Iterative
2. Recursive
3. Functional
4. Unknown
5. Unknown

One of the things that is recommended in this Kata is to keep track of where you
make common errors and have issues over the challenges.

## Running tests

The test file chop\_test.rb takes one argument, the implementation of binary
search to test against. All of them should pass against this test.

## Iterative - Implementation No. 1

A LOT of off by one errors ... even when I cheated on the implementation.
